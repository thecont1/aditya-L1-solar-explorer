# SoLEXS Solar Flare Explorer

## TL;DR

Aditya-L1 is a solar observatory positioned 1.5 million kilometers from Earth at a place called the Lagrangian point L1, providing a continuous view of the Sun. SoLEXS is a spectrometer aboard Aditya-L1 that monitors X-ray emissions from the Sun, every second. This data is valuable for studying solar flares, which are bursts of energy released by the Sun. Now start exploring solar flares by forking the jupyter notebook: [`sun-explorer.ipynb`](sun-explorer.ipynb)

### **Aditya-L1 and a faraway place we call L1**

* On **September 2, 2023, 11:20 IST**, [ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/) launched [Aditya-L1](https://www.issdc.gov.in/adityal1.html), a space-based observatory-class mission to study the Sun.

* The satellite attained orbital insertion at [Lagrange Point 1](https://in.mashable.com/science/78263/isros-aditya-l1-completes-first-orbit-at-lagrange-point-1-what-is-it) (L1), ~1.5 million kilometers from Earth, on **January 6, 2024, 4:17 PM IST**, marking a significant milestone for India's first solar observatory.

* The advantage of being perched (in a halo orbit) at L1 is that Aditya-L1 has secured for itself an astronomical seat with a forever uninterrupted view of the Sun.

### **The Source of Our Data**

* The spacecraft carries seven payloads to observe the photosphere, chromosphere and the corona of the Sun. As far as this notebook is concerned, we will focus our attention on the **Solar Low Energy X-ray Spectrometer (SoLEXS)**, a sun-as-a-star spectrometer developed by the *U.R. Rao Satellite Centre, Bengaluru*.

* The primary science objectives of SoLEXS are:
  * [Flares and Coronal Heating](https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/76/4/34/2879433/Unveiling-the-mystery-of-solar-coronal)
  * [Coronal Abundances and FIP](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-020-01738-5)
  * [Flare ‚Äì CME studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090997712000235)

### **Getting to Know That Data**

* Solar flares are classified on a scale of A, B, C, M and X. Each class is 10 times stronger than the last, with X-class flares being the most powerful

* SoLEXS is capable of covering an extensive dynamic range from A-class to X-class flares. As we will see in the plots, when the Sun flares, the intensity of X-Ray counts can be several standard deviations above the mean.

* Data transmissions started soon after Aditya-L1 reached its destination and its instruments gradually came online. However, the dataset published by ISRO begins from July 1, 2024 onwards.

* ISRO releases data in tranches. The first tranche of solar datasets was released on January 6, 2025, marking the one-year anniversary of Aditya-L1's arrival at L1.

* SoLEXS data is hosted by ISRO's *Indian Space Science Data Centre* (ISSDC) on the [PRADAN portal](https://pradan1.issdc.gov.in/al1/), where one can access it after a quick registration process.

* The FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) is the data format of choice for astroniomical data. SoLEXS data files are provided as gzip compressed FITS files.

## Files

### **Data Setup**:
   * Place your Aditya-L1 SoLEXS ZIP files in a directory
   * Create a `SoLEXS_dataset.paths` file listing the directories containing your data

The tool expects Aditya-L1 SoLEXS data in ZIP files with the following structure:

```text
AL1_SLX_L1_YYYYMMDD_v1.0.zip
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AL1_SLX_L1_YYYYMMDD_v1.0/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SDD2/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AL1_SOLEXS_YYYYMMDD_SDD2_L1.lc.gz
```

The processed data is stored in a Parquet file (`SoLEXS_dataset.parquet`) with the following columns:

* `DATE`: Observation date
* `TIME`: Seconds since midnight
* `COUNTS`: X-ray counts

### **Run the Notebook**:
   * Open `sun-explorer.ipynb` in Jupyter
   * Run all cells to load data and initialize the interface

## Usage Guide

### Getting Started

When you launch the Solar Flare Explorer notebook, it will automatically load the SoLEXS data from the configured paths. You'll see a loading progress bar and a summary of the data similar to this:

<img src="image5-loading.png" alt="Data Loading" width="800">

This indicates the notebook has successfully processed the solar data files and created a `SoLEXS_dataset.parquet` datafile ready for analysis. 

**As you can see, the dataset contains over 21 million consecutive seconds of observation, from July 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025.** However, due to space limitations on GitHub, the dataset available here is for a subset of this period.

### Customizing Your Analysis

The interactive control panel allows you to select specific time periods and adjust detection parameters:

<img src="image6-controls.png" alt="Control Panel" width="800">

* **Date and Time Selection**: Choose the start and end dates/times to focus on a specific observation period
* **Sigma**: Controls the sensitivity of flare detection (higher values detect only stronger flares)
* **Gap**: Sets the minimum time (in seconds) between separate flares
* **Zoom**: Determines how many minutes to display when viewing a single flare in detail
* **Update Analysis**: Click this button to refresh the analysis with your new settings

### Exploring Solar Flares

After updating the analysis, you'll see a light curve showing X-ray activity from the Sun during your selected period:

<img src="image7-lightcurve.png" alt="Solar Flare Light Curve" width="800">

* The **blue line** shows the X-ray count rate over time
* The **green line** shows the median count level
* The **red line** shows the detection threshold (median + sigma √ó standard deviation)
* **Pink labels** mark detected flares with their peak times

### Examining Individual Flares

The final plot shows a zoomed-in view of the largest solar flare detected in the previous step. To observe any other flare, adjust the time window so that the flare of your choice is visible in the light curve plot, click <span style="background-color: #00aa00; color: white; padding: 3px 5px 3px 5px;">‚ñ∂Ô∏éUpdate Analysis</span> and then come back here and click <span style="background-color: #00b0b0; color: white; padding: 3px 5px 3px 5px;">üîÑUpdate</span>:
